# Richie - Self Introduction

Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning/afternoon. My Chinese name is Wang Ruiqi. I'm happy and excited to be here, to give my first English show. I'm 10 years old, and a student of grade 4.

I like swimming, and riding bicycle with my family. I started playing piano 2 years ago, just in this summer, I got the certification of piano level 4. Moreover, I'm also a guitar player of my school.

But I love English most, I've read a lot of English story books. Most of them are very interesting, like "Around the World in Eighty Days", "The Old man and the Sea", etc.

Next I'll start my dubbing show.

Thank you.
