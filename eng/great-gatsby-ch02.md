# Chapter 02, The Buchanan

The story of the summer really begins on the evening I drove to East Egg to have dinner with my cousin Daisy, and her husband Tom Buchanan.
I’d known Tom from college l. His family was enormously rich.
Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white mansion, overlooking the bay.
Tom had turned to a sturdy man of thirty with two arrogant eyes.
He waved to me in the front of the house.

```
How the hell are you, Nick?
I’ve been well, Tom. It’s been so many years.
I’ve got a nice place here, haven’t I? This garden, it’s designed by an Italian artist.
It looks gorgeous. Where’s Daisy?
She’s in the living room. Go and find her. I’ll tell you when dinner’s ready.
```

A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in and out like pale flags.
In the room there was an enormous couch, like a ballon on which two young women were floating.

```
That’s funny.
Did they miss me back in Chicago?
```

Daisy’s face was sad and lovely with bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth.
It was the kind of face that every man had dream of.

```
Oh yes, they all love you so much.
How gorgeous! Where do you live now?
I rented a small house in West Egg.
West Egg?
```

The voice came from the other girl on the couch. She was slender and had small breasts.
He looked at me with charming, contemptuous curiosity.

```
Nick, this is Jordan Baker, she’s a professional golf player.
Nice to meet you, Miss Baker.
You live in West Egg, then you must know Gatsby.
Gatsby? What Gatsby?
I’m starving. Let’s all have dinner. Come on.
```

Our dinner was on a rose-colored porch, opened toward the sunset. Tom kept talking and talking loudly.

```
Civilization’s going to pieces. Have you read the book “The rise of the Colored Empires”?
Why, No.
Well everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be - will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff.
That phone call will be for me.
I love to see you at my table, Nick. Now if you’ll excuse me.
This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor -
Don’t talk, I want to hear what happens.
Is something happening?
Tom got some women in New York.
Got some women?
She might have that decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?
```

Almost before I grasped her meaning, Tom and Daisy went back to the table.
Our dinner was awkward, and I left quickly afterwards.
That night when I got home, a figure had emerged on the dock from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion.
He was standing with his hands in his pockets, looking at stars.
Something tells me that it was Mr. Gatsby himself.
Suddenly, he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way.
As far as I was from him, I could have sworn that he’s trembling.
I glanced seaward - and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away.
