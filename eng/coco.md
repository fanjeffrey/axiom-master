# Coco

[Music]

[Miguel Narrator]
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.
Cause of something that happened before I was even born.
See, a long time ago, there was this family.
The Papa, he was a musician.
He and his family would sing and dance,
and count their blessings.
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.
And one day,
he left with his guitar,
and never returned.
And my Mama...
she didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician.
After banishing all music from her life,
she found a way to provide for her daughter.
She rolled up her sleeves,
and she learned to make shoes.
She could've made candy,
o-o-or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.
But no.
She chose shoes.
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.
And later, she taught her son-in-law.
Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew, so did the business.
Music had torn her family apart,
but shoes held them all together.
You see, that woman
was my great-great-grandmother, Mama Imelda.
She died way before I was born.
But my family still tells her story,
every year on Dia de los Muertos - the Day of the Dead.
And the little girl,
she's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco.

[Townspeople]
There he is!

[Father]
Miguel! Stop!

[Grandmother]
Where have you been?

[Migeul]
Ah! I need to see Mama Coco, please!

[Grandmother]
Huh! What are you doing with that?
Give it to me!
Miguel, Stop.
Miguel! Miguel?
Miguel!

[Miguel]
Mama Coco?
Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.
I-I saw your Papa!
Remember? Papa?
Please.
If you forget him,
he'll be gone,
forever.
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?
See, there he is.
Papa, remember? Papa?

[Grandmother]
Miguel!

[Miguel]
Mama Coco, please. Don't forget him.

[Grandmother]
What are you doing to that poor woman?
It's okay, mother.

[Father]
What's gotten into you?

[Miguel whimpering]

[Father]
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

[Miguel]
I'm sorry, Papa.

[Mother]
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

[Miguel]
Not all of us.

[Grandmother]
It's okay, Mamita.
Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco.

[Miguel]
Mama Coco...

[Grandmother]
Well, apologize.

[Miguel]
Mama Coco,
your Papa,
he wanted you to have this.

[Father]
Mama, wait!

[Miguel singing]
Remember me,
though I have to say goodbye.
Remember me,
Don't let it make you cry.
For even if I'm far away, (Look!)
I hold you in my heart.
I sing a secret song to you,
each night we are apart.

Remember me,
Though I have to travel far.
Remember me,
Each time you hear a sad guitar.
Know that I'm with you,
The only way that I can be,
Until you're in my arms again.
Remember...
me...

[The End]
