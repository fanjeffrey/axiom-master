# Chapter 3, The Wilson

The fact that Tom had a mistress was known wherever he showed up. Though I was curoius to see her, I had no desire to meet her - but I did, eventually.

Tom drove me into the city one day. We passed through The Valley of Ashes, driving past the dirty houses and people with gray faces. Suddenly we stopped at a garage. The sign-board read "Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold."

```
Is there something wrong with your car?
I want you to meet my girl.
Hello, George, old man, how's business?
Well, I... I can't complain. When... when are you going to sell me that car?
Next week, I've got my man working on it.
Well, He... he works pretty slow, don't he?
No, he doesn't. And if you feel that way about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.
No, I don't mean that, I just mean...
```

Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. A woman with her mid thirties, appeared from the office door at the second floor. She was a bit stout, but in a sensuous way. She smiled slowly, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost. She shook hands with Tom, looking at him straight in the eyes. Without turning aroud, she spoke to her husband.

```
Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.
Oh, sure, sure.
I want to see you, get on the next train.
Alright.
I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.
```

She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. Toms and I stayed for a while, and left the garage afterwards.

```
Oh God, this place is terrible. If it weren't for Myrtle, I'd never come down here. It does her good to get away.
Doens't her husband object?
George? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb and he doesn't know he is alive.
```

So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York - or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat descreetly in anothe car. We saw a man selling puppies along the way. Tom bought one and argued with the man over the price. He gave Myrtle the puppy when we met up in a news-stand in the city.

```
Eee... It's so cute. Thank you, Tom. I'm going to name him Puddles. 
Well, just make sure he doesn't make any messes on the floor. I payed a lot for this apartment.
Aw... you wouldn't make a mess, would you Puddels? You're such a good dog.
```

Having no intentiong to get involved in whatever was between them, I suggested leaving them there. But they insisted that I should stay and enjoy some excitement in the city. I compromised finally half imagining this excitement they mentioned.
