# Chapter 5, The "Excitement"

There was music coming from my neighbor's house all through out the summer nights. In his blue garden men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagnes and the stars. One day, I got a strange invitation. Mr. Jay Gatsby was having one of his frequent parties, and I was invited. Dressed up in my best suit, I went over to his lawn. I made an attempt to find my host, but the people I asked stared at me in such amazed way and shook their heads. So I headed over to the cocktail table to get rid of this sheer embarrassment, when finally I saw someone I knew - Jordan Baker.

```
Hello.
Thought you might be here. I remembered you lived next door.
Are you invited too?
No one is invited to Gatsby's.
Well I am. Seems like I'm the only one.
```

We sat donw at a table with two girls in twin yellow dresses.

```
You come to this party often?
Yes, I like to come. There's something funny about a fellow that'll hold a party like this.
That Gatsby, he doesn't want any troble with anybody.
Somebody told me - Somebody told me he killed a man once.
I don't think it's so much that. It's more that he was a German spy during the war.
Oh, no, it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war.
I don't believe that Gatsby killed anyone, do you?
Well let's find him and ask.
```

We walked into an important-looking door. It was a high Gothic library. A stout, middle-aged man, with enourmous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table.

```
All these books... They're all real.
Why wouldn't they be?
Some people buy fake books for their libraries. But not Gatsby.
And that means?
Means? It means he paid for real books. This house, and everything in it, are all part of a deliberate disguise.
But what are these for?
That, my friend, is the question.
```

We shook hands with him and went back outdoors. Jordan and I went outside and sat down at a table with two other men. I had taken a lot of Champagne and was quite enjoying myself. The man in a black suit looked at me and smiled.

```
Your faces is familiar. Weren't you in First Division during the war?
Why, yes! I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.
I was in the Sixteenth! I know I'd seen you somewhere before. I was going to try my new hydroplane tomorrow morning. Want to go with me, old sport?
What time?
Anytime that suits you best.
Well thanks! And thanks to Mr. Gatsby for this party. I live just next door, but I've never seen him -
I'm Gatsby.
