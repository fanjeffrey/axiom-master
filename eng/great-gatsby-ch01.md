# Chapter 1, New York, New York

1922, New York. It all seems like a dream now. My name is Nick Caraway. I'm going to tell you the story now. Because I believe it needs to be told. It's about this man I know, a man with an extraordinary gift of hope. I've never found this gift in any other person, and I doubt I ever will. It's the story of Gatsby.

1922, New York. The economy was booming, the parties were reveling, and the alcohol was overflowing, despite the prohibition. Wall Street was luring ambitious young men, and I was one of them.

```
Say where're you from, Mr. Caraway? You don't look like the New York type.
I'm from Chicago.
Chicago! A lot of people here in West Egg come from Chicago. What do you do?
I'm in bond business.
That's a very promising job, Mr. Caraway. Did you study finance back in college?
No, actually I studied literature. I'm still learning bond business.
Literature! Shakespeare and stuff uh? So what did you do after graduation?
I went to the Great War.
You went to the war? Was it exciting?
Well, if you say so. Maybe that's way I came back to New York. I want more excitement.
Yes, I'm sure you'll find a lot of excitement here.
```

```
Here we are. This is the house you've rented. A very nice house. You can't never find a better house with such a beautiful price in West Egg, I guarantee you. Do you know much about West Egg?
I can't say that I do.
It's a wonderful place, really. There's a lot of new money in West Egg, It's not like East Egg. Everyone over there is pretty conceited. Their families all made their money decades ago.
My cousin lives in East Egg.
I'm sorry. Mr. Caraway. I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm not offended at all. She is somewhat conceited.
Why don't you show me the rest of the house.
Yes, yes. Right this way, Sir.
```

```
As you can see, it's fairly standard house. It got two bedrooms. And here, let me show you the kitchen. It's equipped with most modern uh... Mr. Caraway?
```

Outside the window, there is a colossal building, with a tower on one side, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. That is marvelous.

```
Oh, that house! It belongs to a very rich gentleman. His house is always full of people. He throws a lot of parties. You understand?
That sounds exciting.
But you know what's weird? No one in the parties even really knows him, except his name, Gatsby.
```

That's the first time I heard the name Gatsby. By then I had no idea that my life would be changed completely by this name, and everything it stood for.
