# Chapter 07, "God's Truth" about Gatsby

After that night, I mounted Gatsby's hydroplane, and also went to tow more of his parties. But it was not until one morning in late July that he called on me with his gorgeous yellow car.

```
Morning, old sport. Are your ready to go?
This is...quite the car you've got!
It's pretty, isn't it, old sport? Now let's sit in it! I'm taking you to the city for lunch.
```

Gatsby never drove his car - he raced it. I've talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past months, but to my disappointment, he had little to say. It was not until this time that he began to talk about himself.

```
A look here, old sport. What's your opinion of me anyhow?
My opinion?
Yes, your opinion. I'm gonna tell you something about my life. I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.
Just some of them...
I'll tell you the God's truth, old sport. I'm the son of some wealthy people from the Middle West - they are all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. As you can see, it's a family's tradition.
What part of Middle West?
San Francisco.
I see.
My family, they, they all die and I came into a good deal of money. After that I travelled in all of the capitals in Europe - Paris, Venice, Rome, but I was trying to forget something very sad that happend to me a long time ago.
```

The way he spoke betrayed him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him conceived me otherwise.

```
What was that sad thing?
You'll know very soon. So then came the war, old sport. I tried hard to die, but I seemed to have an enchanted life. Here you see, is something I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days.
```

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men. There was Gatsby, looking a little younger, with a cricket bat in his hand.

```
Look, old sport, I'm gonna make a big request of you today. I didn't want you to think that I was just some nobody.
A big request?
Yes, Miss Baker will explain everything to you. I happend to find out that you're taking Miss Baker to tea.
Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?
No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Bake has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.
```

I hadn't the faintest idea what "the matter" was, but I was more annoyed that interested. I hadn't askded Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. We continued racing on the road, when suddenly a policeman rode a motorcycle alongside.

```
Pull over! Pull over your car.
Hold on for a minute, old sport. I'll take care of this.
Do you have any idea that how fast you were going?
I wouldn't worry about me, officer. Here is my license.
Oh...Right your are... I'll know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!
Think nothing of it. Come on, Nick. Let's get going.
