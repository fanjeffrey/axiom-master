# Chapter 9, Gatsby's Big Request

Later that afternoon, I met Jordan for tea. I had thought this was just bewteen me and Jordan, but the "big request" Gatsby mentioned totally ruined it.

```
So what game is Gatsby playing?
Shh...Please, be quiet, people can hear you.
He took me to the city in his fancy car and then just disappeared and then ask you to ask me a big request in a -
He wanted you to invite Daisy to tea.
Daisy... and Gatsby? Why?
I don't quite know where to start... I'd met Gatsby five years ago, in Louisville. Daisy was by far the most popular of all the young girls. When I walked by her house that morning, she was sitting in her white roadster, with a lieutenant I'd never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other. He looked at her in a way every girl dreams of being looked at. His name was Jay Gatsby.
So, what happened next?
Gatsby was sent off to war. Daisy waited and waited, until the war ended, but somehow he didn't return. A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago showed up and took her heart away. He gave her a string of pearls valued at 350,000 dollars. Then, the day before her wedding, she got a letter and couldn't stop crying.
Tell them Daisy changed her mind.
What was in the letter?
I don't know. But it was too late. Next day at five o'clock, she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver. The pearls were around her neck. The wedding had more pomp than Louisville had ever seen.
Dose Daisy really love this rich guy?
Well, I've never seen a girl so mad about her husband, the way she looked at him. It was touching to see them together. But that was in August. Tom had a car incident later. The girl sitting with him, was some chambermaid, from some hotel. Of course, this is not some big news in the city.
It was a strange coincidence that Gatsby went back and found Daisy.
It wasn't a coincidence at all.
Why not?
Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay. He wants to know if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.
Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?
He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.
Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?
He doesn't want to do anything out of the way. He just wanted to see her right next door. And your house is right next door.
Oh! Dose she want to see Gatsby?
She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You are just supposed to invite her to tea. I think he half expected her wander into one of his parties, but she never did.
