# Chapter 06, Who is Gatsby?

```
What! I beg you pardon.
I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.
```

He smiled understandingly. It was one of the rare smiles that you may come across four of five times in life. It understood you, believed in you just as you wanted to be understood and believed in. He was a year or two over thirty, an elegant young man with a rough neck. His speech had an elaborate formality that seemd almost absurd. It seems as though he was picking his words with care. Before we went into deeper conversation, a butler hurried toward him.

```
Excuse me Sir, a call from Chicago.
If you want anything just ask for it, old sport. Now excuse me, I'll join you later.
```

When he was gone, I turnded immediately to Jordan, full of surprise.

```
So you finally met him?
I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be -
Old and fat?
Yes, young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace in Long Island. Who is he?
He's just a man named Gatsby.
Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?
Now you're started on the subject. Well, he once told me that he was an Oxford man.
Wow, that's -
However, I don't believe it.
Why not?
I don't know. I just don't think he went there. Anyhow, he gives large parties. And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties, there isn't any privacy.
```

```
Ladies and gentlemen, at the request of Mr. Gatsby, we're going to play for you the Jazz History of the World.
```

I wan't attracted by the "Jazz History", because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby. He was standing alone on the marble steps, watching the crowd. His short hair looked as though it was trimmed everyday. The fact that he was not drinking set him off from his guests. I can see nothing sinister about this man. Suddenly, Gatsby's butler came up to Jordan.

```
I beg you pardon, Miss Baker, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you, alone.
With me?
Yes, madame.
```

Jordan got up slowly and walked away with the butler. I was left alone and wandered into the house. One hour later, the door of the library opened and Jordan and Gatsby came out together. Several people approached to Gatsby and say good-bay. There was an unspeakable astonishment on Jordan's face.

```
I've just heard the most amazing thing. It was...simply amazing. But I swore I wouldn't tell you and here I am tantalizing you.
```

Before I could ask more Jordan left with her friends, and I waited until Gatsby's friends were gone.

```
I wanted to apologize for not recognizing you again. I look for you the whole evening.
Don't give it another thought, old sport. And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock.
I won't miss it. Good night.
Good night.
```
