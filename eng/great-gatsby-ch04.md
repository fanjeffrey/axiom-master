# Chapter 3, The "Excitement"

Tom’s apartment was small and on the top floor. The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it. Tom borough out a bottle of whisky, while Myrtle called up her sister on the phone.

```
Oh, that’s must be her now. You’ll like her, Nick. She has a lot fun, just like me.
```

Her sister, Lola, was a slender worldly girl of about thirty. She had a red bobbed hair, and her face was powdered milk white.

```
Lola, you’re here. Look what Tom bought me. Isn’t he so cute?
He’s such a cutie. Where will I find a man like you, Tom?
Haha. Come on, get inside. That’s Nick. I’ll get more iced whisky.
Where do you live, handsome?
I live in West Egg.
Really?
I was down there at a party about a month ago, at a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?
I live next door to him.
Well, they say he is a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.
Really?
I’m scared of him. I would never marry a guy like that.
Better than marrying a man who’s way below you.
Why would you, Myrtle? Nobody forced you to.
I married him, because I thought he was a gentleman, I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoes.
You’re crazy about him for a while.
Crazy about him? The only crazy thing I did was marry him. I knew right away I made a mistake.
Let’s put on some music and dance. Tom? What happened to your whisky. She really ought to get away from him. They’ve been living in that garage for eleven years. And Tom is the first sweetie she ever had.
```

I’ve been drunk just twice in my life. The second time was that afternoon. I wanted to get out and walked eastward, through the park and the soft twilight. But each time I tried to go, I became entangled in some wild argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Some casual watcher on the street must’ve seen the secrets in this room, and I saw him too. I was within and without, enchanted and repelled by an endless variety of life.

I woke up midnight. Lola was asleep beside me. Tom and Myrtle were arguing about something in the other room.

```
Just don’t say her name. I can’t stand it when you say her name.
I can’t say her name. You talked about Gorge all the time. But I can’t say Daisy’s precious little name.
I’m warning you Myrtle. If you’ll don’t quit…
Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.
Shut up.
You actually hit me. You animal, you actually hit me.
I warned you.
Bastard, you broke her nose.
That’s what you get, Myrtle. You got what you deserved.
You monster! Get out of here and take your weird friend with you.
Fine. Come on, Nick. We’re leaving.
Never come back.
