# Chapter 8, Meyer Wolfshiem

It was a roaring noon. The place Gatsby took me to lunch was in a dark cellar. There is only a small window from which I can see the brightness of the street outside.

```
Mr. Gatsby, my boy. You deign to join us in our little hovel. And you've brought a friend!
Mr. Wolfshiem, this is my friend, Mr. Caraway.
Ah, Mr. Caraway, pleasure to meet you. Wolfshiem, at your service. Let's go and sit over in my quiet little booth.
```

Meyer Wolfshiem was a flat-nosed Jewish man, with a large head. He regarded me with two fine growth of mustashe. It took me a moment to find his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.

```
Mr. Wolfshiem is a brilliant man, Nick. I've known him ever since...
```

Suddenly Gatsby looked at his watch and jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.

```
He has to telephone. Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman. From one of the finest families in the midwest.
Yes.
An Oxford man, too. You know Oxford College, don't you?
I've heard of it.
When I first made his acquaintance after the war, I said to myself: There is the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister. A war hero. Won a lot of medals. I see you're looking at my cuff buttons. Finest specimens of human molars.
That's very interesting idea.
Yeah! Yeah, Gatsby's very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.
Gentelmen! Everything all right?
Yes! Yes, we... we were just talking about other people's wives.
Other people's wives?
Now, my work is done. You tow sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies.
Who is he anyhow?
Who? Mr. Meyer? He is a gambler. He is the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.
Fixed it?
Fixed it.
How did he manage it?
He just saw the opportunity.
Why isn't he in jail?
They can't get him, old sport. He is a very smart man. A lot of smart men down here. Look over there. That man is the police commissioner. And over there by the band, he is a congressman. That man he is talking to is a smuggler...
```

```
Nick! Nick!
```

From across the crowded table, Tom is yelling and coming towards us. Surprised to see him here, I introduced Gatsby to Tom. They shook hands briefly. And a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.

```
How have you been anyhow? Daisy's furious because you haven't called up. How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?
Tell her that I'm sorry. I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.
```

I turned toward to Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.
