# Chapter 17, Waiting

The Buchanan's house floated suddenly toward us through the darkness. Tom stoppted at the porch and looked at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.

```
Daisy's home. Nick, I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home. While you are waiting, you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper, if you want any.
No, thanks. I'll just wait outside.
Won't you come in, Nick?
No, thanks.
Have it your own way.
```

I've had enought of all of them for the whole day, and suddenly that included Jordan. I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, when suddenly Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path.

```
What're are you doing here?
Just standing here, old sport. Did you see any trouble on the road?
Yes.
Was she killed?
Yes.
I thought so. I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.
Daisy? A woman has died and all you care now is Daisy?
Who is the woman?
Her name is Myrtle Wilson, her husband owns the garage. How the devil did that happen?
It all happened so quickly, we're passing a car coming in the other way, and this woman rushed out at us, and she is trying to speak to us. She tried to -
She?
Well - I tried to swing the wheel -
Was Daisy driving?
Yes, but Of course I'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive - It all happend in a minute. It wasn't her fault. She'll be all right tomorrow. I'm just going to wait here to see if Tom tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon, and if he tries any brutality -
He won't touch her. He's not thinking about her.
I don't trust him, old sport.
How long are you going to wait?
All night if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.
You wait here. I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.
```

I went through the lawn, and outside the window, I saw Tom and Daisy. He was talking intently to her, and putting his hands on Daisy's. Once in a while, she looked up at him and nodded in agreement. There was an unmistakable air of intimacy about the picture, and anyone would have said that they were conspiring together. I went back to the path where Gatsby was waiting and... I didn't know what to tell him.

```
Is all quiet up there?
Yes. It's all quiet. You'd better come home and get some sleep.
No, I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.
```

He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house. I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight - watching over nothing.
